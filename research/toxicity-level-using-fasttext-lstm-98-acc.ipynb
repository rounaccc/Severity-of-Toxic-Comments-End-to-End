Thank You!**\n","\n","## **Introduction**\n","Identifying harassment in social media discussions is vital, as is determining the number of unpleasant sentiments conveyed inside the comment. Organizations can save time and manual labor in regulating these platforms by automating this comment classification approach.The primary purpose is to determine the level of negativity and toxicity in internet comments. This could help to identify people who abuse individuals. As a result, it will eventually assist in the execution of policies and the penalty of individuals who do not obey, which can subsequently be used to reduce the level of toxicity in discussions. Using LSTM, CNN and FastText we aspire to build a multi-label classification model that separates comments into six groups according to their toxicity level: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity-hate.\n","\n","**We have used FastText word embedding to make the model more efficient even on the unseen data.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# **Importing
